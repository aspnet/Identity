ASP.NET Identity is the new membership system for building ASP.NET web applications. ASP.NET Identity allows you to add login features to your application and makes it easy to customize data about the logged in user. 

This project is part of ASP.NET 5. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET 5 at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
